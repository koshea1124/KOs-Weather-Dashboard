KO's Weather Dashboard: Plan Your Trips with Confidence

The Weather Dashboard is a powerful and user-friendly web application designed to provide you with accurate and up-to-date weather information for multiple cities. Whether you're a traveler or simply curious about the weather outlook, this dashboard will help you plan your trips and stay informed about current and future weather conditions.
Using the OpenWeather API, our dashboard retrieves real-time weather data for cities worldwide. By leveraging the 5 Day Weather Forecast API, you can access detailed weather forecasts for any location. 

Features and Functionality:
User-Friendly Interface:
The Weather Dashboard features an intuitive and user-friendly interface. You'll find a search bar where you can input the desired city to retrieve weather information.
Current and Future Conditions:
Once you search for a city, the dashboard will provide you with both the current weather conditions and the forecast for the upcoming days. You'll be presented with essential information such as the city name, date, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
5-Day Forecast:
The dashboard goes beyond just the current weather conditions. You can explore the future weather outlook for the next five days, including the date, an icon representing weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. This comprehensive forecast allows you to plan ahead and make informed decisions.
Search History:
The Weather Dashboard keeps track of your searches. Every time you search for a city, it is added to the search history, which you can conveniently access. By clicking on a city in the search history, you can quickly retrieve the current and future weather conditions for that location without having to search again.

## Overview
### The Challenge
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
